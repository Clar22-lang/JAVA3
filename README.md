# Java Miniatures

Java Miniatures is a comprehensive repository dedicated to honing Java programming skills and delving into software engineering concepts. As a passionate Computer Science graduate aspiring to excel in the field of Software Engineering, I've curated this repository to serve as a platform for my continuous learning journey and to showcase my expertise in Java programming.

## **What the Repository Does:**

The repository encompasses a wide range of **Java topics**, starting from fundamental concepts and progressing towards more advanced **software engineering principles**. Each section of the repository is meticulously crafted to provide clear explanations, code examples, and practical projects, all aimed at deepening understanding and mastery of Java and its application in real-world software development scenarios. The repo will include the fundamental Computer Science topics.

## **Challenges Faced and Future Features:**

Throughout this learning journey, I've encountered various challenges, both technical and conceptual. However, each challenge has served as an opportunity for growth and learning. In the future, I aim to implement additional features such as interactive coding exercises, more extensive project examples, and collaborative learning opportunities to further enhance the repository's utility and effectiveness as a learning resource.

## Part One : 1 - Java Basics

**Getting Started**
according to Java Docs official website [Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/).

> \'Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented programming language'

_**general puprose**_ means you can build applications using this language in a wide range of different domains.

_**concurrent**_ means the ability of the language to execute mulitple processes in the same time

**_strongly-typed_** means the strict attatchment of language syntax to define variabels datatypes

**_class based object oriented_** means this language structure is based on object oriented concepts and use of classes

**These charactaristics of the labguage will be more clear as we go in this repo**
